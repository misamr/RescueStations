# RescueStations

Data : https://storage.googleapis.com/montco-stats/tz.csv
Here is data from accidents that happen in city XYZ.

Evil zombies have destroyed all central rescue stations in the city. The state has statistics where emergency problems occurred in last year (data above) and they are not sure whether the emergency stations were placed efficiently. Note that ambulances were sent only to EMS problems. Therefore, they asked us to find places where they should build 5 (of the same size) emergency stations. What will their position be? (for the sake of simplicity, you can use manhattan distance, but you can also link it to the real geographic distance if you want :)
